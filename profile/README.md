# Void-Framework

Welcome to **Void-Framework** 👋  
This organization hosts a small, focused ecosystem of Kotlin libraries for building modern web apps with minimal overhead and maximum control.

The goal here is simple: **clean APIs, type-safe HTML, and a lightweight full-stack experience without bloat**.

---

## 📦 Repositories

### 🕳️ Void
**Core web framework**

`Void` is a minimal full-stack web framework written in Kotlin. It includes an embedded HTTP/HTTPS server and gives you just enough structure to build APIs without forcing opinions on logging, DI, or templates.

**Highlights**
- Embedded HTTP/HTTPS server
- Simple static & dynamic routing
- Middleware support
- Coroutine-based async handling
- Easy to test, no external server required

---

### 🧩 Void-HTML
**HTML DSL & utilities**

`Void-HTML` focuses on HTML generation using a Kotlin DSL. It’s designed to work seamlessly with `Void`, but can also be useful on its own for building structured, type-safe HTML in Kotlin projects.

**What it’s for**
- Server-side rendered HTML
- Reusable components/layouts
- Clean, compile-time-safe markup
- Avoiding string-based templates

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

- **Minimal by default** — no hidden magic
- **Composable** — build what you need, nothing more
- **Type-safe** — let the compiler help you
- **HTMX-friendly** — simple interactivity without heavy JS frameworks

---

## 🚧 Status

This ecosystem is actively evolving. Expect breaking changes, experimentation, and new repos (examples, docs, plugins) over time.

If you like small, sharp tools and Kotlin on the backend — you’re in the right place.
