## 👋 About Void

We are **Void**, an ambitious open-source community dedicated to building dev tooling primarily in Kotlin. Our core philosophy revolves around maximizing **Developer Experience (DX)**, making web development intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable. Hailing from the Czech Republic, we're crafting a robust, flexible, and performant foundation for your next big idea.

We believe that developing powerful web applications shouldn't be complex. Void aims to abstract away the boilerplate and let you focus on what truly matters: your application's unique logic and features.

## 🎯 Our Current Focus

- 🔭 Working on: **Core framework stabilization, performance optimizations, and documentation expansion**
- 🌱 Learning: **Exploring advanced Kotlin coroutines, WebAssembly integration, and modern front-end build tooling**
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on: **Feature development, example projects, testing, and ecosystem tooling (IDEs, CLI)**
- 💬 Ask us about: **Kotlin full-stack development, developer experience (DX) best practices, and framework architecture**
- ⚡ Fun fact: **Void is designed to be as "invisible" as possible, letting developers focus on their application logic, not framework internals!**
